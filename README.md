# StockTicker.py
A simple Internet of Things based live feed for stock prices. Based on ThingSpeak and tkinter.

This small piece of software is designed to provide quick access to stock prices for a small watchlist.
Given a set of stocks, we can use the ThingSpeak platform for storing their prices.

Within this program, stock price data is being collected from Yahoo Finance, then sent to ThingSpeak.

Within the software, we are using the "requests" library to quickly go to the links created with ThingSpeak, then collect the data stored there.

Currently the program follows a watchlist of 15 stocks.
Indicies, ETFS, or even bond rates could be followed in a similar manner.

Stay tuned for the complete ReadMe.
However, this software is quite a bit simpler than our previous projects. It should work almost right out of the box.

Good luck in the markets!
